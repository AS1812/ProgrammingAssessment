Attached files : DOCKER APP, Ansible Playbook + Inventory set for my VMWare OpenSuse machine.

* The "APP" folder represents the complete "TODO" application made by following the entire Docker "TODO" app tutorial.

* Ansible Playbook & Inventory set have been made to be able to easily deploy the complete “Todo”
application to my OpenSuse Virtual Machine.

I have also made screenshots attached in the .pdf file. Those screenshots are supposed to ensure that 
everything is working as expected as well as proof of completing all the steps.

The screenshots can also be seen separatly in the "Screenshots" folder in this repository.
